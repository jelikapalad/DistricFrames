					We had different team for our Engagement Session and for some reasons we opted to change photo/video team. 
					I never thought that we made the best and the right decision. The outcome of our wedding coverage was spectacular.
					It was not only us,couple, who were mesmerized by their work, even our families and colleagues felt amazed too. 
					They granted my requests and they were easy to deal with. Moreover, I wasn’t able to meet them personally cause of 
					time constrained but then, they were able to perform beyond my expectations. Thank you District Frames. 
					Hope to still work with you guys in the future ❤️

					One of the most important decisions you have to make when getting married is who will capture every moment on your wedding day.
					District Frames by Nicko Buenaventura and team made it really memorable for us and our family. They captured every detail with 
					passion and love. They knew the value of the day to the couple and they have fully exerted their effort and strength in the things they do. 
					It was drizzling during ceremony, pero sila hindi nagpatinag. Thank you Nicko and team sa pag grant ng mga requests ko. Salamat sa lahat ng 
					tulong ninyo. Our SDE video says it all! You guys rock! The best kayo! You captured the joy, love and fun of our wedding. 5 stars are not 
					enough to describe your skills! Godbless you team District Frames! ���
